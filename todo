# TODO
1. Implement persistent data. sqlite maybe
2. Remove all gh stuff. We will no longer be getting team name and members from the repo. Instead, each api will have an endpoint to
gather this information.
3. Work through all the endpoint responses. These need to be more clear with proper status codes.
4. Make sure all errors are being caught, handled or notifying the user.
